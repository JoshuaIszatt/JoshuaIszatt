## Phage-related tools !
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on edgeBio - This is my first real software project that I'm using to learn javascript. Hopefully it will provide a foundation / entrypoint into web development one day.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning and relearning... pretty much everything phage related! I work at the Kids Research Institute in Western Australia as a postdoctoral researcher studying phage genomics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any software project that I'm able to contribute towards or learn from.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything phage biology, programming (Python or Javascript), or software development (database design, web development).
