## Phage-related tools !
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a web-deplopyable bioinformatics pipeline that follows Good Automated Manufacturing Practices (GAMP) for use at the PhageWA facility in Perth.
- Constantly learning and relearning... pretty much everything phage related! I work at the Kids Research Institute in Western Australia as a postdoctoral researcher studying phage genomics.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any software project that I'm able to contribute towards or learn from.
- 💬 Ask me about anything phage biology, programming (Python or Javascript), or software development (database design, web development).
